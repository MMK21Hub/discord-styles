# Discord Styles

Here are some CSS tweaks that I've made to Discord. Feel free to use some/all of the snippets! They'll work with any method of injecting CSS, such as the Stylus browser extention or the Powercord client mod.

~~These snippets are currently (as Febuary 2022) working, using Discord Canary 113678 (`2a9f76c`) and Powercord v2 (`12de9dc`), and are compatible with Discord's recent class name changes. There are a few old snippets (clearly maked at the bottom of the file) that have not been updated.~~

Feel free to use the [Issues page](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/discord.css/issues) for any feedback/questions.

All commits up to https://github.com/MMK21Hub/discord.css/commit/7bbbd3a (Febuary 2022) were based on the Dracula theme for Powercord, so some of the "fixes" will look out of place in any other theme.
