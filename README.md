# Discord Styles

> **Note**
> **I no longer use Powercord** or any other Custom CSS tool, so this repository will no longer be updated.

## Old README

Here are some CSS tweaks that I've made to Discord. Feel free to use some/all of the snippets! They'll work with any method of injecting CSS, such as the Stylus browser extention or the Powercord client mod.

These snippets are currently working as of as Febuary 2022, using Discord Canary 113678 (`2a9f76c`) and Powercord v2 (`12de9dc`), and are compatible with Discord's recent class name changes. There are a few old snippets (clearly marked at the bottom of the file) that have not been updated.

Feel free to use the [Issues page](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/discord.css/issues) for any questions.

All commits up to [7bbbd3a](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/discord.css/commit/7bbbd3a) (Febuary 2022) were based on the Dracula theme for Powercord, so some of the "fixes" will look out of place in any other theme. The current version of `main.css` is made for the Cumcord client mod.
