# Discord Styles

> **I no longer use Powercord.** PowerCord seems to have a bug that causes Discord to crash on startup. This means that I am no longer able to use my Custom CSS, so this repository will no longer be updated.

## Old README

Here are some CSS tweaks that I've made to Discord using Powercord's Quick CSS feature. Feel free to use some/all of the snippets!

Note that I'm using the [Dracua theme](https://github.com/x6r/dracula), so some snippets might only be relevent to that theme.

These snippets are currently (as Febuary 2022) working, using Discord Canary 113678 (`2a9f76c`) and Powercord v2 (`12de9dc`), and are compatible with Discord's recent class name changes. There are a few old snippets (clearly maked at the bottom of the file) that have not been updated.

Feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/discord.css/issues) for any feedback/questions.
